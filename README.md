## About This Project

This project is due to the high gas prices. Therefore I want to make the central heating radiators more efficient

## Technical Details

I am using an Arduino system to measure the temperature of the environment and the temperature of the radiator. 

If there is a substantional difference in temperature (more than 5 degrees Celsium), three fans mounted untherneat the radiator will start spinning and 
pumping air through the radiator.

This makes the radiator more efficent.
